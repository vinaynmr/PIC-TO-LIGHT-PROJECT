# PIC-TO-LIGHT-PROJECT

ABSTRACT:

Real time application application provable PIC TO LIGHT project is an example of highly efficient usable CAN protocol. CAN enables project to implement best application using PIC18F4580 Microcontroller to implement the best hardware usage SSD display and Data mangement system. For, proper stack type maintance of any product we can use this project
 whereit gives the specific id and and its value is stored permanently and easily modifiable which best purpose for this project. This project makes an easy implementation of the data mangement in the certain business, CAN enable the communication for over the different PIC's(can share with specified servers).

 Applications:

1. High velocity carton flow each picking.
2. Carousel light towers.
3. Sort bars for batch picking from carousels.
4. Full case picking from pallet flow.
5. Component picking for kit assembly.
